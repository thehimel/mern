# Aceternity UI

Aceternity UI is an extension of shadcn/ui.

## Aceternity UI Prerequisites:
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui
* motion, clsx, tailwind-merge

## Installation

* Since you have already installed Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, everything is set up already except motion.
* Therefore, just install motion with `npm install motion`.
* That's it. Now you can add components and use it in your application.
* You can add a component via cli: `npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.aceternity.com/registry/glowing-effect.json`
* You may need to update the imports in the component once they are downloaded: `import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";`
